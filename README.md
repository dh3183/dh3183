## Hi there! 😊✨

I'm a Computer Engineering Student.🐥<br>
Currently I'm Learning Swift, and Interested in [UIKit + RxSwift] and [Swift UI + Combine] combination based Reactive Programming.<br>
I'm interested in not only Programming but also design, so I am also studying UI/UX : )

Preparing to launch App Store : 투둑투둑
